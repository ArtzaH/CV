    <li><strong>02/2018 – Present - Chargeable Repair Officer, Bolton At Home, Bolton</strong><br>
      Bolton at Home own over 18000 properties across Bolton, as a chargeable repair officer it is my job to ensure I correctly identify and monitor works carried out that are chargeable. This involves reviewing data across systems, speaking with
      operatives, and colleagues particularly when it may involve vulnerable tenants, I then have to cost up jobs, write out to tenants, create invoices and then record the information on spreadsheets and various systems. Subsequently I have to deal
      with any complaints or queries that arise. Working as a chargeable repair officer, data input and customer service are vital skills to ensure workloads are kept manageable. It is a challenging role but very interesting and very rewarding.</li>

    <li><strong>11/2016 – 12/2018 - Accounts Assistant, AH Interiors, Nelson</strong><br>
      My role at AH Interiors involved purchase ledger and sales ledger activities as well as administration duties. My daily duties involved creating and inputting sales and purchase invoices and credit notes onto the ledger. Ensuring payments
      received are recorded and deposited into the Bank. I also assisted in payments to supplier by writing out cheques and producing weekly reports for outstanding payments. My other duties involved daily reconciliations of supplier and customer
      accounts and dealing with any queries that arise and where necessary contacting customers via telephone or letter to chase overdue invoices. Also I dealt with the daily post including emails and telephone queries.</li><br>
    <li><strong>11/2016 – 12/2018 - Owner, Adams Grill</strong><br>
      I bought the business in November of 2016. The business at the time was closed. I started by hiring staff, I conducted interviews and selected those candidates I felt had the same drive as me to make the business a success. I created all the
      recipes, dealt with suppliers to obtain supplies and catering equipment and once everything was in place consulted a friend of mine who works in marketing and developed a marketing strategy focusing on a unique selling point which in my case
      was a authentic lamb donner, advertising involved leafleting and Facebook. The business was successful and was later sold. The experience was invaluable, but the most important thing was family who unfortunately suffered as I wasn’t able to
      spend much time with them which made the decision to sell a sensible one.</li><br>
    <li><strong>01/2016 – 10/2016 - Transaction Assistant promoted to Transaction Supervisor, Bolton NHS FT, Bolton</strong><br>
      My role in trust involved processing invoices in a timely fashion ensuring all relevant information held was up to date, the processing of invoices varied depending on the type of invoice for example those with and without purchase order
      numbers, it was also crucial we were aware of the VAT code applicable to invoices so the Trust could reclaim any VAT due. I consistently had the highest number of registrations. I also dealt with invoice and account queries, at one stage it was
      only myself who was tackling queries as two staff members were part-time and one member of staff was on sick however my work ethic and determination saw me through but also I was extremely pro-active and many unresolved issues dating as far
      back to 2013 were resolved by myself, my approach was to identify the problem and then work out a solution identifying the most efficient way and one in line with the Trust policies, the more challenging part of any query was getting in touch
      with colleagues to action what was necessary but this was easily overcome as I have the confidence to pick up the phone and speak to those concerned and explain concisely what the issue was and their role in resolving it, I built very strong
      relationships with colleagues inside and outside the hospital and when I picked up the telephone and asked to speak to them they all knew who I was and what I expected of them. Working in a hospital it is essential to keep suppliers up to date
      to prevent them putting us on stop because ultimately it is life and death, the lack of supplies or staff could unnecessarily postpone an operation which could cause a tragedy. When a supplier did notify us that we were on hold I am proud to
      say I never went home until the supplier had taken us off hold as a result of me resolving their issue and getting in most cases a payment to them. I took the responsibility of teaching my colleagues my approach and encouraging them to excel,
      when a vacancy became available for the transaction supervisor I put my name forward and was successful, I had already formed a good relationship with my colleagues and was managing them indirectly so it wasn’t difficult moving into that role
      in fact I worked a dual role, while learning the additional duties of the supervisor which include payment runs, agreement of balances, cash management, recruitment and training and appraisals I was still helping with queries and registration
      of invoices whilst the trust was recruiting to fill vacancies in the team.</li><br>
    <li><strong>09/2015 – 12/2015 Purchase Ledger Clerk, AO.com, Bolton</strong><br>
      In my role I worked with extremely high volumes and tight deadlines, my duties include inputting invoices roughly 120 an hour, credits from suppliers, and staff expenses using Microsoft AX whilst also logging disputes and liaising with
      suppliers and internally to resolve. Furthermore with overhead invoices and expenses I am tasked with inputting on AX, scanning and distributing to various departments to sign off and upon their return cheques wrote and posted out and invoices
      filed. Currently I deal with LG, Britannia, Sebo, Hisense, Samsung, Smeg, Miele and Swan and have also worked on Hotpoint, Dimplex, Imetec and Techlink. I am tasked with ensuring all invoices and credit and debit notes are logged, creating
      remits for payment and allocating payment and reconciling at month end. I also monitor the purchase ledger mail box and deal with incoming post. I have a good grasp of Microsoft Excel including VLOOKUP’s. The department is currently
      understaffed and longer hours are required and having worked 60+ hours a week in prior jobs I am able to work longer when required.</li><br>
    <li><strong>05/2013 – 09/2015 Type 2 Data Processor, NHS BSA, Bolton</strong><br>
      In my role, I am a data processor. This involves viewing a prescription from which you must, quickly yet accurately, record the drug and the quantity prescribed and dispensed. Attention to detail is vital in order to maintain accuracy, which is
      measured monthly. Having learnt many memory codes, numbers assigned to each drug, the rate of my data processing is increased. My previous IT skills are also an advantage here and so allow me to maintain a fast average, for which bonuses can be
      received. I maintain a near perfect accuracy record and have successfully attained many bonuses. Because of this, I am now assigned onto other streams, some of which are more accuracy orientated whilst others are more related to speed. I also
      volunteered to assist with outbound calls to pharmacies when issues arise, for example prescriptions are unreadable or information is missing.</li><br>

      products. I also assist with data capture. The majority of cases I deal with are account related, varying from missing orders to complex account issues, which may have been ongoing for several months or years and now need resolving. My previous
      experience and skills are applicable to this role such as my communication, teamwork and problem solving skills. Building a rapport with customers is essential but also providing an efficient service. To do this, attention to detail and having
      the ability to offer a clear and concise explanation to the problem as well as a resolution is important but also following up internally when needs be. My work ethic, dedication to the job role and my many commendations received from customers
      demonstrates why I am held in high regards in my position. I meet all my KPI’s relatively easily and have on several occasions been asked to offer help and advice to colleagues who are struggling with maintaining KPIs.</li><br>

    <li><strong>08/2005 – 10/2005 Shop Keeper, Bloom Street Convenience Store, Stockport</strong><br>
      Working within the family business, I took over from my father for a short while. I was in control of all aspects of running the store, which included stock checks, dealing with suppliers, whilst also working on the front line as the shop
      keeper. In this short time, I was able to build upon my customer service skills when dealing face to face with customers, as well as gain an insight into the running and financial management of a business.</li><br>
    <li><strong>04/2005 – 08/2005 Outbound Telemarketer, Intalekt, Nelson</strong><br>

    <li><strong>03/2005 – 06/2005 Telesales, Ourtelecom, Simonstone</strong><br>
      This was a new start-up and I was one of the first employees. My roles initially consisted of canvassing door to door distributing leaflets and gaining sales. Then it evolved in to cold calling the public quickly building a rapport and
      identifying how best to sell our product. Here I learnt to approach everything with a positive attitude and 100% commitment.</li><br>

      daily basis allowed me to experience the many different customers and scenarios which can arise and how to overcome any issues which may occur. I gained invaluable skills in effectively communicating and dealing with customers as well as using
      my initiative to solve any problems.</li><br>

      maintaining their original condition. I was able to work under pressure, within a set time frame and communicated effectively with other workers. As well as this, an eye for detail and excellent teamwork skills were important so to allow a
      smooth system for the flow of goods.</li><br>
