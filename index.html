  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I am currently employed as a chargeable repair officer for Bolton at Home. I have been in this position for approximately a year and six months. It is an incredibly challenging and diverse role, and I am thoroughly enjoying every moment of it as
    it has truly enabled me to showcase my skills and become much more confident both inside and outside of work. I have contributed immensely by implementing improvements including automating processes, improving morale, reviewing existing processes
    and influencing colleagues to help streamline processes. I have been involved in several projects including repair analysis, which I am currently working on as part of a team identifying flaws in the current process and developing ideas to
    improve the customer experience. I also worked on a new stream of work which was brought in. Initially it was only myself who was working on the implementation with a view to it being rolled out across the wider team. However I was able to
    identify several areas which linked closely with my own role and was able to influence my own team to take on the additional work and also management that the work should sit within the chargeable repair team. I then continued to lead this
    project by creating and implementing the training which is monitored and updated by myself, and as the role evolves I continue to offer improvements and lead by example. I am actively networking and advertising my skills for example I had offered
    to help a colleague struggling with Excel formulas which led to my involvement in the procurement process to select a DCA whereby i was asked to score and help select a new supplier.
    I have worked in quite a number of organisations and in hindsight maybe a little too many, sometimes working two jobs at a time, but every job has taught me new and improved existing skills. I was naive and worked to fulfil short term goals, with
    little thought on the future, but with the experience and skills I now possess both from employment and in my personal life I believe I am a much better employee and possess a drive and commitment to fulfil my potential.
    During the many years of employment I have learnt many attributes including time management and organisational skills and I have also vast experience working as part of teams learning skills such as communication and influencing. Having worked in
    a variety of roles, I have the ability to easily adapt to new situations and environments and have established excellent working practices. My many years experience in customer service has helped me build up my communication and conflict
    management skills, with both customers and work colleagues enabling me to be confident and concise whilst communicating. I am methodical and a problem solver and can quickly assess situations and make effective decisions, these skills I have
    gained can be applied to any role I am given. A very recent example of this is at the NHS, where I initially joined as a transaction assistant and within 6 months was promoted to supervisor, this was achieved by being pro-active and utilising my
    attributes and experience, but ultimately It was recognised that I am very good at what I do and when an opportunity arose I was by far the outstanding candidate. I am ambitious and have learnt that through hard work and determination any goal is
    achievable. My experiences and attributes, I believe, have shaped me to become the well-rounded and driven person I am today.</p><br>

  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I feel strongly about leading a clean rewarding lifestyle, in respect to exercising and eating healthily, but also ensuring I am mentality active. Cooking is something I do regularly a hobby which allows me to express my creativity and also
    spend time with my family and ensure we are all eating healthily. I also attend the gym, participate in circuits and lifting weights and regularly play squash; I am currently a green belt in Tang Soo Do and hope to progress further, once my
    children start alongside me.<br>
    <br>
    I am passionate about staying active and so have developed a willingness to try new things, both in my personal life and work life. This includes being part of a promotional video where I spoke about being a chargeable repair officer; this video
    was later played at the cinema during our quarterly updates which all staff at Bolton at Home attended and is routinely played at other events.<br>
    <br>
    I am also a Parent Governor at my children’s school, again challenging due to the recent problems the school has endured but extremely rewarding. I attend all meetings both resource and teaching and actively input, it is a role I have only been
    in for approximately six months but I am eager to grow into the role and help the school thrive and for the children to be given all the tools needed to succeed.<br>
    <br>
    I have a keen interest in economics and current affairs and particularly enjoy debates in these topics. I also enjoy reading biographies and learning from the experiences of those who have been successful, especially in the face of hardship. I
    also have a fondness for Sudoku.<br>
    <br>
    I am fully adept at using Microsoft Word, Excel including Vlookup, Pivot Tables and VBA, Outlook and PowerPoint.<br>
    <br>
    I am also self learning programming, a skill which has intrigued me for many years, and with the wealth of knowledge and resources available online, I felt it was an ideal time to start. Currently I would consider my skills intermediate in HTML,
    and I am progressing with CSS, JavaScript and Node JS. I am also learning with my daughter Python 3, to encourage her development. We will look to create our own IOS/Android app soon.</p>
