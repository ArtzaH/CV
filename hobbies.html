  <p>I feel strongly about leading a clean rewarding lifestyle, in respect to exercising and eating healthily, but also ensuring I am mentality active. Cooking is something I do regularly a hobby which allows me to express my creativity and also
    spend time with my family and ensure we are all eating healthily. I also attend the gym, participate in circuits and lifting weights and regularly play squash; I am currently a green belt in Tang Soo Do and hope to progress further, once my
    children start alongside me.<br>
    <br>
    I am passionate about staying active and so have developed a willingness to try new things, both in my personal life and work life. This includes being part of a promotional video where I spoke about being a chargeable repair officer; this video
    was later played at the cinema during our quarterly updates which all staff at Bolton at Home attended and is routinely played at other events.<br>
    <br>
    I am also a Parent Governor at my childrenâ€™s school, again challenging due to the recent problems the school has endured but extremely rewarding. I attend all meetings both resource and teaching and actively input, it is a role I have only been
    in for approximately six months but I am eager to grow into the role and help the school thrive and for the children to be given all the tools needed to succeed.<br>
    <br>
    I have a keen interest in economics and current affairs and particularly enjoy debates in these topics. I also enjoy reading biographies and learning from the experiences of those who have been successful, especially in the face of hardship. I
    also have a fondness for Sudoku.<br>
    <br>
    I am fully adept at using Microsoft Word, Excel including Vlookup, Pivot Tables and VBA, Outlook and PowerPoint.<br>
    <br>
    I am also self learning programming, a skill which has intrigued me for many years, and with the wealth of knowledge and resources available online, I felt it was an ideal time to start. Currently I would consider my skills intermediate in HTML,
    and I am progressing with CSS, JavaScript and Node JS. I am also learning with my daughter Python 3, to encourage her development. We will look to create our own IOS/Android app soon.</p>
